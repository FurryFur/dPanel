### This is the Standard Data container format followed on the dPanel setup.

This can be easily used generically as well..

It provides the following volumes which can be used from the other Containers.

/data
/backup
/var/lib/mysql
/var/www


Our other standard containers like Apache/Nginx/etc will use these volumes to persist their data.

You can add more volumes in Dockerfile if you wish to OR you can just use the subdirectories under /data for postgres/etc.

#### how to build
docker build -t stddata .

#### how to start a data volume
docker run --name appdata stddata

#### how to use in other containers
docker run -ti --name whatever --volumes-from appdata ubuntu /bin/bash


On our dPanel however each Datacontainer WILL be named as the sitename
and will be auto linked to every other container that is started together.
